The Risky Dealer Case Study Transactions file (unzip data/Risky Dealer Case Study.zip) contains records of wholesale vehicle sales. Each record gives specific details of the sales transaction. Note that only some of these transactions have a DealShield guarantee applied to them, and of those, some result in a returned vehicle and others do not. Descriptions of each field contained in the file are given below. Also note that the data is not intended to be perfect. That is, as usual, data that you have to use in your analysis is often "dirty" and may contain occassional erroneous or missing values. You must treat these accordingly and provide reasoning behind any action you may take to handle such data.
